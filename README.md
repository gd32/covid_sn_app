# Visualizing Network Interventions for Controlling the Spread of COVID-19

This app is a companion to our research article **Network Interventions for Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Sustaining Economy**, in print in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS). The app demonstrates the efficacy of the "dividing groups" strategy and the "balancing groups" strategy described in our article using network-based visualizations. 

Under the **Microsimulation** tab, users can modify the network size, infection rate, and intervention type and view the progression of an infectious disease through the generated social network. Disease and network metrics are presented on the graph. 

## Version History

### Version 1.1
- Updated color scheme and graph paramaterization.
- Reordered tabs which now includes the *Details* tab.

### Version 1.0
- First version based on accepted manuscript.
- Microsimulation updated to use accepted version of code.

### Version 0.1
- Initial release

The app has 4 panels. 
1) Microsimulation
    * A simulation of a social network (maximum population size: 40) in presence of an infection. Built using igraph. Adjustable parameters     include **population size**, **infection rate**, and **intervention type**.
    
    
2) New Cases
    * An animated version of Fig. 2A from the original research article. Adjustable parameters: **Scenario**.
    
    
3) Dynamics
    * An animated version of Fig. 2B from the original research article. Adjustable parameters: **Scenario**.
    
    
4) Network Ties
    * An animated version of Fig. 2C from the original research article. Adjustable parameters: **Scenario**.


#### Upcoming updates:
  Additional graphs to complement microsimulation.
  Affiliation graphics with UCLA Fielding School of Public Health (pending research publication).
