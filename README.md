# Visualizing Network Interventions for Controlling the Spread of COVID-19

This app is a companion to our research article **Network Interventions for Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Sustaining Economy**, currently under review. The goal of this app is to provide readers of the article and other interested individuals with an animated visualization of the way an infection spreads through a simulated social network and how our proposed interventions can limit that spread.

Under the Simulation tab is a microsimulation similar to those we ran for our research article and a corresponding social network visualization.

The remaining 3 tabs (new cases, dynamics, and network ties) are animated versions of the figures we presented in our article.

The app is best viewed on a laptop or desktop at 1920 x 1080 resolution. You can find the app [here.]( https://gdewey.shinyapps.io/covid_sn/)

## Version History

### Version 0.1
- Initial release

The app has 4 panels. 
1) Microsimulation
    * A simulation of a social network (maximum population size: 40) in presence of an infection. Built using igraph. Adjustable parameters     include **population size**, **infection rate**, and **intervention type**.
    
    
2) New Cases
    * An animated version of Fig. 2A from the original research article. Adjustable parameters: **Scenario**.
    
    
3) Dynamics
    * An animated version of Fig. 2B from the original research article. Adjustable parameters: **Scenario**.
    
    
4) Network Ties
    * An animated version of Fig. 2C from the original research article. Adjustable parameters: **Scenario**.


#### Upcoming updates:
  Additional graphs to complement microsimulation.
  Affiliation graphics with UCLA Fielding School of Public Health (pending research publication).
