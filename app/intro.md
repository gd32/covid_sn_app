## Introduction

This Shiny app serves to complement our research article **Network Interventions for Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Sustaining Economy**, currently under review. The goal of this app is to provide readers of the article and other interested individuals with an animated visualization of the way an infection spreads through a simulated social network and how our proposed interventions can limit that spread.

Under the **Simulation** tab is a microsimulation similar to those we ran for our research article and a corresponding social network visualization.

The remaining 3 tabs (**new cases**, **dynamics**, and **network ties**) are animated versions of the figures we presented in our article. 

This app is best viewed on a laptop or desktop at 1920 x 1080 resolution.
