## Introduction

This Shiny app is a complement to our research article **Network Interventions for Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Sustaining Economy**, in print in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). The app demonstrates the efficacy of the "dividing groups" strategy and the "balancing groups" strategy and a combination of the two strategies using a downscaled version of the simulations we used to generate the results in our article. 

Under the **Simulation** tab, users can modify the network size, infection rate, and intervention type and view the progression of an infectious disease through the generated social network. Disease and network metrics are presented on the graph. Network size and other population parameters have been limited for memory purposes.
