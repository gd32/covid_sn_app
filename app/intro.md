## Introduction

This Shiny app is a complement to our research article **Network Interventions for Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Sustaining Economy**, in print in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS). The app demonstrates the efficacy of the "dividing groups" strategy and the "balancing groups" strategy described in our article using network-based visualizations and accompanying graphs. 

Under the **Simulation** tab, users can interact with a small-scale version of the network-based simulations we used to generate the data reported in the manuscript. Network size and other population parameters have been limited for memory purposes.

The remaining 3 tabs (**new cases**, **dynamics**, and **network ties**) are animated versions of the figures we presented in our article. 

This app is best viewed on a laptop or desktop at 1920 x 1080 resolution.
