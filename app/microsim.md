## Microsimulation Instructions

This is a visualization of the spread of infection through a social network after the application of a network intervention. Choose an **intervention**, **population size**, and **infection rate** to apply your settings, then click the play button to begin the simulation. 

Each population is seeded with 10 infections at the start of the simulation and each simulation lasts for 60 simulated days. You should be able to see people passing through the 4 stages of the SEIR model (susceptible, infected, exposed, and recovered).
