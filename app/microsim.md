## Introduction

This Shiny app is a complement to our research article **Network Interventions for Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic and Sustaining Economy**, in print in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS). The app demonstrates the efficacy of the "dividing groups" strategy and the "balancing groups" strategy and a combination of the two strategies using a downscaled version of the simulations we used to generate the results in our article. 

#### Microsimulation Instructions

This is a visualization of the spread of infection through a social network after the application of a network intervention. 

On the right column, you can modify the network size, infection rate, and intervention type and view the progression of an infectious disease through the generated social network. Disease and network metrics are presented on the graph and will update when a new simulation is run. Choose an **intervention**, **population size**, and **infection rate**, then click the **apply** button to send your choices to the app. The **play** button will automatically progress the simulation and visualization from 0 days to 60 days. You can pause the simulation at any time using the pause button (while the animation is playing).

Each population is seeded with 10 infections at the start of the simulation. You should be able to see people passing through the 4 stages of the SEIR model (susceptible, infected, exposed, and recovered).

#### Note: Simulation performance may be affected if too many users are currently accessing the app. Please use the [mirror](link) if you notice the simulation being particularly slow or if the animation is not playing smoothly. Alternatively, wait a few moments and try to run your simulation again.
